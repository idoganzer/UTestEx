# Handling webhooks from Stripe

In our integration with Stripe, we need to handle webhooks to receive real-time notifications about events that occur in a Stripe account. This section explains how we handle webhooks from Stripe in our codebase.

To handle webhooks from Stripe, we follow these steps:

1.  **Setting up the webhook endpoint**: We create a webhook endpoint in our application to receive incoming webhook events from Stripe. This endpoint is responsible for verifying the authenticity of the webhook event and processing it accordingly. The code snippet below shows an example of how we set up the webhook endpoint in `app.js`:

2.  **Verifying the webhook signature**: Upon receiving a webhook event, we need to verify its authenticity to ensure that it was sent by Stripe. We use the `stripe` library to verify the signature of the webhook event. The code snippet below demonstrates how we verify the webhook signature in `webhookController.js`:
3.  **Handling the webhook event**: Once the webhook event is verified, we process the event based on its type. Depending on the event type, we may need to update our database, trigger certain actions, or send notifications to users. The code snippet below shows an example of how we handle a specific webhook event in `webhookController.js`:

# Wrapper modules for Stripe

In our integration with Stripe, we use wrapper modules to encapsulate the functionality and provide a simplified interface for interacting with the Stripe API. These wrapper modules abstract away the complexity of the underlying API and provide a more convenient and consistent way to work with Stripe in our codebase.

The wrapper modules for Stripe can be found in the following files:

*   `path/to/stripeWrapper1.ts` (see snippet)

*   `path/to/stripeWrapper2.ts` (see snippet)

*   `path/to/stripeWrapper3.ts` (see snippet)

These wrapper modules handle tasks such as authentication, request/response handling, and mapping the API responses to our internal data structures. They provide a higher-level interface that aligns with our coding conventions and best practices.

By using wrapper modules, we ensure that the integration with Stripe is decoupled from the rest of our codebase. This allows for easier maintenance and future updates as the Stripe API evolves.

When working with Stripe in our codebase, it is recommended to utilize these wrapper modules to interact with the Stripe API. This ensures consistency and reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for common operations.

For example, to create a new customer in Stripe, instead of directly calling the Stripe API endpoints, we can use the `createCustomer` method provided by the `StripeWrapper` module. This method handles the necessary authentication and request/response handling, making it easier to work with Stripe in our codebase.

To see how the

# Design decisions in the Stripe integration

In the Stripe integration, we have made several design decisions to ensure a smooth and efficient integration with the Stripe library. These decisions were made based on our specific requirements and best practices for integrating with Stripe.

## Wrapper modules

To wrap access to the Stripe library, we have implemented several wrapper modules. These modules provide a simplified and standardized interface for interacting with Stripe, abstracting away the complexity of the underlying library.

One of the key design decisions we made was to create a separate module for each major functionality provided by Stripe, such as payments, subscriptions, and customer management. This modular approach allows for better organization and maintainability of the codebase.

By encapsulating the Stripe functionality within wrapper modules, we are able to isolate any changes or updates to the Stripe library, minimizing the impact on the rest of our codebase. Additionally, these wrapper modules provide a clear and consistent API for other parts of our application to interact with Stripe.

## Main flow integration

The main flow of the Stripe integration consists of several steps, each serving a specific purpose in the payment process. Throughout the integration, we have made certain design decisions to optimize performance, enhance security, and improve the user experience.

1.  **Step 1**: Initialization - In this step, we initialize the Stripe library and configure it with our API keys. This allows us to establish a secure connection with the Stripe servers and authenticate our requests.

2.  **Step 2**: Customer creation - When a new
