# Setting up the Stripe API keys

To integrate with the Stripe API, we need to set up the necessary API keys. This section will guide you through the process of obtaining and configuring the Stripe API keys in our codebase.

## Obtaining the API keys

To obtain the Stripe API keys, follow these steps:

1.  Log in to the Stripe Dashboard.

2.  Navigate to the API section.

3.  Generate a new set of API keys for your integration.

Once you have obtained the API keys, we need to configure them in our codebase.

## Configuring the API keys

To configure the Stripe API keys in our codebase, follow these steps:

1.  Open the `config.js` file in the `src` directory.

2.  Locate the `STRIPE_API_KEY` variable.

3.  Replace the placeholder value with the actual API key obtained from the Stripe Dashboard.

```javascript
// src/config.js

const config = {
  STRIPE_API_KEY: '
```

<br/>



<br/>

', // Other configuration options... };

export default config;

```

Make sure to replace `
```

22             end = new Date((new Date()).setDate(now.getDate() + (range || 7))),
23             endString = end.getFullYear() + "-" + (end.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + (end.getDate());
24         return [startString,endString]
25     };
```

## Verifying the configuration

To verify that the Stripe API keys are correctly configured, you can run a test transaction in our application and check if it interacts with the Stripe API successfully.

For example, you can initiate a test payment and ensure

# Handling Payment Errors

In our integration with the 3rd party library or service, we have implemented a robust error handling mechanism to handle payment errors. This section will explain how we handle payment errors in our codebase.

## Error Wrapper Module

To handle payment errors, we have created a dedicated error wrapper module that encapsulates the logic for handling errors returned by the 3rd party library or service. This module provides a centralized way to handle and process payment errors throughout our codebase.

As seen in the code snippet from `path/to/errorWrapper.js` (see snippet), the error wrapper module intercepts any errors thrown by the 3rd party library or service and transforms them into a standardized format that can be easily consumed by our application.

## Error Handling Flow

When a payment error occurs, we follow a specific flow to handle and process the error. The steps involved in the error handling flow are as follows:

1.  **Capture Error**: As seen in the code snippet from `path/to/paymentHandler.js` (see snippet), we capture the payment error returned by the 3rd party library or service.

2.  **Log Error**: We log the payment error for debugging and auditing purposes. This helps us track and investigate any issues related to payment errors.

3.  **Notify User**: Depending on the severity of the payment error, we notify the user about the error and provide relevant information or instructions on how to resolve the issue. This ensures a smooth user experience and helps in

# Managing subscriptions with Stripe

In our codebase, we have implemented a way to manage subscriptions using the Stripe payment gateway. This section will explain how we integrate with Stripe and the design decisions made during the integration process.

## Wrapper modules

To interact with the Stripe API, we have created wrapper modules that provide a simplified interface for managing subscriptions. These modules abstract away the complexity of the Stripe API and provide a more streamlined experience for our developers.

As seen in the code snippet from `path/to/stripeWrapper.ts` (see snippet), we have implemented functions such as `createSubscription`, `cancelSubscription`, and `updateSubscription` that handle the necessary API calls to Stripe.

## Integration flow

The integration with Stripe for managing subscriptions follows the following steps:

1.  **Creating a subscription**: To create a new subscription, we use the `createSubscription` function from the Stripe wrapper module. This function takes the necessary parameters such as the customer ID and the plan ID, and makes the appropriate API call to Stripe to create the subscription.

2.  **Updating a subscription**: If a user wants to upgrade or downgrade their subscription, we use the `updateSubscription` function from the Stripe wrapper module. This function allows us to modify the plan associated with the subscription and handles the necessary API calls to Stripe.

3.  **Canceling a subscription**: When a user decides to cancel their subscription, we use the `cancelSubscription` function from the Stripe wrapper module. This function sends the cancellation request to Stripe
