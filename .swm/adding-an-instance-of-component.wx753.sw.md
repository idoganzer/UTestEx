Understanding IDO\_TESTs and how they work is an important part of contributing to our system.

This document will describe all you need to know about IDO\_TESTs.

A IDO\_TEST is BLA.

Some examples of IDO\_TESTs are: {add examples here}

# Basic Example

We'll follow the implementation of {Example Component (an instance of Component)} for this example.

{add a high-level description of Example Component}.

# TL;DR

1.  Create a class inheriting from {base class} in {add a "/path" of a containing folder, and / or describe the file naming convention}
    
2.  Define {add class level variables / constants / types to define}
    
3.  Implement {add names of methods to implement}
    
4.  Update {add a file that needs to be updated with the new class (add class / name of class to a list, import it somewhere, etc.}
    

# Add the New Class

### Inherit from {base class}

We first need to define our class in {mention relevant file}, and inherit from {base class}

<br/>

## Define {add class level variables / constants / types to define}

Every IDO\_TEST should define these at the class level:

*   {variable name}: {why we need to define variable name/what it does}
    
*   {another variable}: {why we need to define another variable/what it does}
    
*   ...

<br/>



<br/>

# Implement {method names to implement}

The goal of {first method} is to {explain what this method does}.

### 游늯 communication.js
```javascript
游릴 20         let now = new Date(),
游릴 21             startString = now.getFullYear() + "-" + (now.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + (now.getDate()),
游릴 22             end = new Date((new Date()).setDate(now.getDate() + (range || 7))),
游릴 23             endString = end.getFullYear() + "-" + (end.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + (end.getDate());
游릴 24         return [startString,endString]
```

## **Update additional files with the new class**

Every time we add a new IDO\_TEST, we reference it in a few locations:

## Usage example

In this example we can see how our new IDO\_TEST can be used:
