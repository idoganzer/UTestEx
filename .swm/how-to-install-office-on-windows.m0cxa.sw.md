**Microsoft Word** is a [word processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor) developed by [Microsoft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft). It was first released on October 25, 1983,[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-9) under the name _Multi-Tool Word_ for [Xenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix) systems.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-PCHistory-10)[\[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-11)[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-12) Subsequent versions were later written for several other platforms including: [IBM PCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC) running [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS) (1983), [Apple Macintosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Macintosh) running the [Classic Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS) (1985), [AT&T UNIX PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_UNIX_PC) (1985), [Atari ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST) (1988), [OS/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2) (1989), [Microsoft Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows) (1989), [SCO Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Unix) (1990), [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS) (2001), [Web browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browsers) (2010), [iOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS) (2014) and [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) (2015). Using [Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine_(software)), versions of Microsoft Word before 2013 can be run on [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).

Commercial versions of Word are licensed as a standalone product or as a component of [Microsoft Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office) suite of software, which can be purchased either with a perpetual license or as part of a [Microsoft 365](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_365) [subscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service).

## History\[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microsoft_Word&action=edit&section=1)\]

_Main article:_ [emHistory of Microsoft Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft_Word)

### \*\*Origins\[\*\*[strongedit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microsoft_Word&action=edit&section=2)**\]**

In 1981, Microsoft hired [Charles Simonyi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Simonyi), the primary developer of [Bravo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bravo_(software)), the first [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI) [word processor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor), which was developed at [Xerox PARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_(company)).[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-pcworld_word25-13) Simonyi started work on a word processor called _Multi-Tool Word_ and soon hired [Richard Brodie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Brodie_(programmer)), a former Xerox intern, who became the primary software engineer.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-pcworld_word25-13)[\[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-14)[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-15)

Microsoft announced Multi-Tool Word for [Xenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenix)[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-pcworld_word25-13) and MS-DOS in 1983.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-infoworld_multi-tool_word-16) Its name was soon simplified to _Microsoft Word_.[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-PCHistory-10) Free demonstration copies of the application were bundled with the November 1983 issue of [emPC World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_World), making it the first to be distributed on-disk with a [magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine).[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-PCHistory-10)[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-NYTimes19930825-17) That year Microsoft demonstrated Word running on [Windows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows).[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-lemmons198312-18)

Unlike most [MS-DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) programs at the time, Microsoft Word was designed to be used with a mouse.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-infoworld_multi-tool_word-16) Advertisements depicted the [Microsoft Mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Mouse) and described Word as a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG), windowed word processor with the ability to [undo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undo) and display bold, italic, and underlined text,[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-byte198312-19) although it could not render [fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font).[\[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-PCHistory-10) It was not initially popular, since its user interface was different from the leading word processor at the time, [WordStar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordStar).[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-20) However, Microsoft steadily improved the product, releasing versions 2.0 through 5.0 over the next six years. In 1985, Microsoft [ported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porting) Word to the [classic Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS) (known as Macintosh System Software at the time). This was made easier by Word for DOS having been designed for use with high-resolution displays and laser printers, even though none were yet available to the general public.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-lowendmac_history-21) It was also notable for its very fast cut-and-paste function and unlimited number of undo operations, which are due to its usage of the [piece table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piece_table) data structure.[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-22)

Following the precedents of LisaWrite and MacWrite, Word for Mac OS added true [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) features. It fulfilled a need for a word processor that was more capable than [MacWrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacWrite).[\[23\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-23) After its release, Word for Mac OS's sales were higher than its MS-DOS counterpart for at least four years.[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-pcworld_word25-13)

The second release of Word for Mac OS, shipped in 1987, was named Word 3.0 to synchronize its version number with Word for DOS; this was Microsoft's first attempt to synchronize version numbers across platforms. Word 3.0 included numerous internal enhancements and new features, including the first implementation of the [Rich Text Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format) (RTF) specification, but was plagued with bugs. Within a few months, Word 3.0 was superseded by a more stable Word 3.01, which was mailed free to all registered users of 3.0.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-lowendmac_history-21) After MacWrite Pro was discontinued in the mid-1990s, Word for Mac OS never had any serious rivals. Word 5.1 for Mac OS, released in 1992, was a very popular word processor owing to its elegance, relative ease of use, and feature set. Many users say it is the best version of Word for Mac OS ever created.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-lowendmac_history-21)[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-msdn_macword6-24)

In 1986, an agreement between [Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari) and Microsoft brought Word to the [Atari ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST)[\[25\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-Microsoft_Write_for_Atari_ST-25) under the name _Microsoft Write_. The Atari ST version was a port of Word 1.05 for the Mac OS[\[26\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-Microsoft_Write_for_Atari_ST_review-26)[\[27\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-Microsoft_Word_for_Atari_ST-27) and was never updated.

The first version of Word for Windows was released in 1989. With the release of [Windows 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.0) the following year, sales began to pick up and Microsoft soon became the market leader for word processors for [IBM PC-compatible computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer).[\[13\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-pcworld_word25-13) In 1991, Microsoft capitalized on Word for Windows' increasing popularity by releasing a version of Word for DOS, version 5.5, that replaced its unique user interface with an interface similar to a Windows application.[\[28\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-28)[\[29\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-29) When Microsoft became aware of the [Year 2000 problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem), it made Microsoft Word 5.5 for DOS available for free downloads. As of FebruaryÂ 2021, it is still available for download from Microsoft's website.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-30) In 1991, Microsoft embarked on a project code-named Pyramid to completely rewrite Microsoft Word from the ground up. Both the Windows and Mac OS versions would start from the same code base. It was abandoned when it was determined that it would take the development team too long to rewrite and then catch up with all the new capabilities that could have been added at the same time without a rewrite. Instead, the next versions of Word for Windows and Mac OS, dubbed version 6.0, both started from the code base of Word for Windows 2.0.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-msdn_macword6-24)

With the release of Word 6.0 in 1993, Microsoft again attempted to synchronize the version numbers and coordinate product naming across platforms, this time across DOS, Mac OS, and Windows (this was the last version of Word for DOS). It introduced AutoCorrect, which automatically fixed certain typing errors, and AutoFormat, which could reformat many parts of a document at once. While the Windows version received favorable reviews (e.g., from _InfoWorld_[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-infoworld_word6-31)), the Mac OS version was widely derided. Many accused it of being slow, clumsy, and memory intensive, and its user interface differed significantly from Word 5.1.[\[24\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-msdn_macword6-24) In response to user requests, Microsoft offered Word 5 again, after it had been discontinued.[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-ugeek_97-32) Subsequent versions of Word for macOS are no longer direct ports of Word for Windows, instead featuring a mixture of ported code and native code.

Microsoft Word (2007)

Word for Windows is available stand-alone or as part of the Microsoft Office suite. Word contains rudimentary desktop publishing capabilities and is the most widely used word processing program on the market. Word files are commonly used as the format for sending text documents via e-mail because almost every user with a computer can read a Word document by using the Word application, a Word viewer or a word processor that imports the Word format (see [Microsoft Word Viewer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word_Viewer)).

Word 6 for [Windows NT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT) was the first 32-bit version of the product,[\[33\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-33) released with Microsoft Office for Windows NT around the same time as [Windows 95](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_95). It was a straightforward port of Word 6.0. Starting with Word 95, each release of Word was named after the year of its release, instead of its version number.[\[34\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-34)

Word 2007 introduced a redesigned user interface that emphasized the most common controls, dividing them into tabs, and adding specific options depending on the context, such as selecting an image or editing a table.[\[35\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-office2007ui2-35) This user interface, called Ribbon, was included in Excel, PowerPoint and Access 2007, and would be later introduced to other Office applications with [Office 2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2010) and Windows applications such as Paint and WordPad with [Windows 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7), respectively.[\[36\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-36)

The redesigned interface also includes a toolbar that appears when selecting text, with options for formatting included.[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-office2007ui-37)

Word 2007 also included the option to save documents as [Adobe Acrobat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Acrobat) or XPS files,[\[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-office2007ui-37) and upload Word documents like blog posts on services such as WordPress.

Word 2010 allows the customization of the Ribbon,[\[38\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-pcmag_office2010-38) adds a Backstage view for file management,[\[39\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-pcmag_backstage-39) has improved document navigation, allows creation and embedding of screenshots,[\[40\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-pcmag_word2010-40) and integrates with online services such as Microsoft [OneDrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OneDrive).[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-41)

Word 2019 added a dictation function.

Word 2021 added co-authoring, a visual refresh on the start experience and tabs, automatic cloud saving, dark mode, line focus, an updated draw tab, and support for ODF 1.3.

### \*\*Word for Mac\[\*\*[strongedit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Microsoft_Word&action=edit&section=4)**\]**

_See also:_ [emMicrosoft Office Â§ Mac versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office#Mac_versions)

The Mac was introduced on January 24, 1984, and Microsoft introduced Word 1.0 for Mac a year later, on January 18, 1985. The DOS, Mac, and Windows versions are quite different from each other. Only the Mac version was [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) and used a graphical user interface, far ahead of the other platforms. Each platform restarted its version numbering at "1.0".[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-42) There was no version 2 on the Mac, but version 3 came out on January 31, 1987, as described above. Word 4.0 came out on November 6, 1990, and added automatic linking with Excel, the ability to flow text around graphics, and a WYSIWYG page view editing mode. Word 5.1 for Mac, released in 1992 ran on the original 68000 CPU and was the last to be specifically designed as a Macintosh application. The later Word 6 was a Windows port and poorly received. Word 5.1 continued to run well until the last Classic MacOS. Many people continue to run Word 5.1 to this day under an emulated Mac classic system for some of its excellent features, such as document generation and renumbering, or to access their old files.

Microsoft Word 2011 running on OS X

In 1997, Microsoft formed the [Macintosh Business Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Business_Unit) as an independent group within Microsoft focused on writing software for [Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_9). Its first version of Word, Word 98, was released with Office 98 Macintosh Edition. Document compatibility reached parity with Word 97,[\[32\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-ugeek_97-32) and it included features from Word 97 for Windows, including spell and grammar checking with squiggles.[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-appleinsider_history-43) Users could choose the menus and keyboard shortcuts to be similar to either Word 97 for Windows or Word 5 for Mac OS.

Word 2001, released in 2000, added a few new features, including the [Office Clipboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipboard_manager), which allowed users to copy and paste multiple items.[\[44\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-atpm-44) It was the last version to run on [classic Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS) and, on [Mac OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS), it could only run within the [Classic Environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Environment). Word X, released in 2001, was the first version to run natively on, and required, Mac OS X,[\[43\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-appleinsider_history-43) and introduced non-contiguous text selection.[\[45\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-macworld_wordx-45)

Word 2004 was released in May 2004. It included a new Notebook Layout view for taking notes either by typing or by voice.[\[46\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-macworld_2004-46) Other features, such as tracking changes, were made more similar with Office for Windows.[\[47\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-macnn_2004-47)

Word 2008, released on January 15, 2008, included a Ribbon-like feature, called the Elements Gallery, that can be used to select page layouts and insert custom diagrams and images. It also included a new view focused on publishing layout, integrated bibliography management,[\[48\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-appleinsider_word2008_1-48) and native support for the new Office Open XML format. It was the first version to run natively on Intel-based Macs.[\[49\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-appleinsider_2008-49)

Word 2011, released in October 2010, replaced the Elements Gallery in favor of a Ribbon user interface that is much more similar to Office for Windows,[\[50\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-appleinsider_ribbon-50) and includes a full-screen mode that allows users to focus on reading and writing documents, and support for [Office Web Apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Web_Apps).[\[51\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word#cite_note-appleinsider_2011_2-51)

Word 2021 added real-time co-authoring, automatic cloud saving, dark mode, immersive reader enhancements, line focus, a visual refresh, the ability to save pictures in SVG format, and a new Sketched style outline.
