# Setting up the Stripe API keys with changes

To integrate with the Stripe API, we need to set up the necessary API keys. This section will guide you through the process of obtaining and configuring the Stripe API keys in our codebase.

## Obtaining the API keys

To obtain the Stripe API keys, follow these steps:

1.  Log in to the Stripe Dashboard.

2.  Navigate to the API section.

3.  Generate a new set of API keys for your integration.

Once you have obtained the API keys, we need to configure them in our codebase.

## Configuring the API keys

To configure the Stripe API keys in our codebase, follow these steps:

1.  Open the `config.js` file in the root directory of our project.

2.  Locate the section where the Stripe API keys are defined.

3.  Replace the placeholder values with the actual API keys obtained from the Stripe Dashboard.

```javascript
// config.js

module.exports = {
  stripe: {
    apiKey: '
```

### ðŸ“„ communication.js
```javascript
20         let now = new Date(),
21             startString = now.getFullYear() + "-" + (now.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + (now.getDate()),
22             end = new Date((new Date()).setDate(now.getDate() + (range || 7))),
23             endString = end.getFullYear() + "-" + (end.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + (end.getDate());
24         return [startString,endString]
```

<br/>

' } };

```

Make sure to save the changes after updating the API keys.

## Verifying the configuration

To verify that the Stripe API keys are correctly configured, you can run a test transaction in our application. If the transaction goes through successfully, it means that the API keys are set up correctly.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up the Stripe API keys in our codebase. Now we can

# Processing a payment with Stripe

In our codebase, we have implemented a payment processing functionality using the Stripe API. This section will explain how we integrate with Stripe to process payments.

## Wrapper module for Stripe integration

To facilitate the integration with Stripe, we have created a wrapper module that encapsulates the interaction with the Stripe API. This module provides a simplified interface for performing common payment-related tasks, such as creating a payment intent, handling webhooks, and retrieving payment details.

The wrapper module can be found at `path/to/stripeWrapper.js` (see snippet).

## Integration flow

The integration with Stripe involves several steps to successfully process a payment. Each step is described below:

1.  **Initializing the Stripe client**: Before interacting with the Stripe API, we need to initialize the Stripe client by providing our API keys. This is done in the `initializeStripeClient` function, located in `path/to/stripeWrapper.js` (see snippet).

2.  **Creating a payment intent**: To initiate a payment, we create a payment intent using the `createPaymentIntent` function from the Stripe wrapper module. This function takes the necessary payment details as parameters and returns a payment intent object. The implementation of this function can be found in `path/to/stripeWrapper.js` (see snippet).

3.  **Collecting payment details**: Once the payment intent is created, we collect the necessary payment details from the user, such as the card information and billing address. This step is handled by
