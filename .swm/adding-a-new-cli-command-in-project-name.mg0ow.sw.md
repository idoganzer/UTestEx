This is draft

The {Project Name} CLI is used for chnages.

We use the {add library name with link} library to implement the generic CLI logic. In this doc you will learn how the {Command Name} command was implemented.

<br/>

<div align="center"><img src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/swimmio-content/o/repositories%2F5uDzblDyNSQUaETEGltk%2F1f20ce9f-92b6-45ff-a476-3a55dd900d44.png?alt=media&token=21bf3a7a-9a98-4abe-bb0b-d0599a031889" style="width:'25%'"/></div>

<br/>

Every command has to be HELLO in {add a prerequisite location} in order to be recognized by the CLI framework.

<br/>



<br/>

Every command has a corresponding {file / module / function} for implementation.
