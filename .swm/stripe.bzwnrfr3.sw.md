# Creating a Payment with Stripe

In our codebase, we have implemented a seamless integration with the Stripe payment gateway. This section will explain how we create a payment using Stripe in our application.

To create a payment with Stripe, we follow these steps:

1.  **Step 1**: Set up the necessary configuration for Stripe. This includes providing the API keys and any other required credentials. (

```javascript
20         let now = new Date(),
21             startString = now.getFullYear() + "-" + (now.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + (now.getDate()),
22             end = new Date((new Date()).setDate(now.getDate() + (range || 7))),
23             endString = end.getFullYear() + "-" + (end.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + (end.getDate());
24         return [startString,endString]
```

2.  **Step 2**: Create a payment intent using the Stripe API. This involves specifying the amount, currency, and any additional payment details. (

# Setting up the Stripe API keys

To integrate with the Stripe API, we need to set up the necessary API keys. This section will guide you through the process of obtaining and configuring the Stripe API keys in our codebase.

## Step 1: Obtaining the Stripe API keys

To obtain the Stripe API keys, follow these steps:

1.  Log in to your Stripe account.

2.  Navigate to the API section in the dashboard.

3.  Generate a new set of API keys for your integration.

<br/>



<br/>

## Step 2: Configuring the API keys in our codebase

Once you have obtained the Stripe API keys, you need to configure them in our codebase. Follow the steps below:

1.  Locate the configuration file where we store the API keys.

2.  Open the configuration file in your preferred text editor.

3.  Find the section related to Stripe API keys.

4.  Replace the placeholder values with the actual API keys obtained from Stripe.

<br/>



<br/>

## Step 3: Verifying the API key configuration

After configuring the API keys, it is important to verify that the configuration is correct. To do this, follow these steps:

1.  Run the test suite or a specific test case that interacts with the Stripe API.

2.  Monitor the test output for any errors related to authentication or API key
