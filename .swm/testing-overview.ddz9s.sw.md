## Testing frameworks

We use {{UNITTEST FRAMEWORK (e.g., jest)}} for unit tests, and {{E2E FRAMEWORK (e.g., cypress)}} for our end-to-end tests.

## Running tests locally

### Configure automation user and password

To run the tests, you first need to configure the user and password.

### Run the tests

You can then use the following commands to run tests: bla

`yarn test`

## Writing tests

### Assertions

{{Add examples of common assertions used by tests}}

### Best Practices

When writing tests, we follow a few guidelines.

A group of tests is called a "suite". We now have several test suites, each one aims to test a certain set of features in the app. For example, {{path for a test file}} tests the {{feature's name}} feature.

{{Add specific best practices you would like to share}}
