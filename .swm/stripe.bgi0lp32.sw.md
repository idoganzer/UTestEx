# Setting up the Stripe API keys

To integrate with the Stripe API, we need to set up the necessary API keys. This section will guide you through the process of obtaining and configuring the Stripe API keys in our codebase.

## Obtaining the API keys

To obtain the Stripe API keys, follow these steps:

1.  Log in to the Stripe Dashboard.

2.  Navigate to the API section.

3.  Generate a new set of API keys for your integration.

Once you have obtained the API keys, we need to configure them in our codebase.

## Configuring the API keys

To configure the Stripe API keys in our codebase, follow these steps:

1.  Open the `config.js` file in the `src` directory.

2.  Locate the `STRIPE_API_KEY` variable.

3.  Replace the placeholder value with the secret API key obtained from the Stripe Dashboard.

```javascript
// src/config.js

const config = {
  STRIPE_API_KEY: '
```

This code snippet generates a start and end date string based on the current date and an optional range parameter. The start date string is in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" and represents the current date. The end date string is calculated by adding the range (default is 7) to the current date and also formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD". The code returns an array containing the start and end date strings.

```javascript
20         let now = new Date(),
21             startString = now.getFullYear() + "-" + (now.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + (now.getDate()),
22             end = new Date((new Date()).setDate(now.getDate() + (range || 7))),
23             endString = end.getFullYear() + "-" + (end.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + (end.getDate());
24         return [startString,endString]
```

', // Other configuration options... }; nothing good start at a gateway car.

module.exports = config;

```

Make sure to keep the API keys secure and avoid committing them to version control. We recommend using environment variables or a secure configuration management system to store and retrieve the API keys at runtime.

With the Stripe API keys properly configured, our integration with Stripe is ready to use.

# Creating a customer in Stripe

To create a customer in Stripe, we follow a specific process that integrates with the Stripe API. This section will outline the steps involved in creating a customer and any design decisions made during the integration process.

## Wrapper module

Before diving into the specific steps, it's important to note that we have a wrapper module that provides a simplified interface for interacting with the Stripe API. This module abstracts away the complexities of the API and provides a more streamlined integration experience.

As seen in the code snippet from `path/to/stripeWrapper.ts` (see snippet), we have a `createCustomer` function that handles the creation of a customer in Stripe. This function takes in the necessary parameters and makes the appropriate API calls to create the customer.

## Step 1: Collect customer information

The first step in creating a customer in Stripe is to collect the necessary information. This typically includes details such as the customer's name, email address, and payment method information.

As seen in the code snippet from `path/to/createCustomer.ts` (see snippet), we have a function `collectCustomerInformation` that prompts the user for the required information and returns an object containing the collected data.

## Step 2: Validate customer information

Once the customer information is collected, it is important to validate the data before proceeding with the creation of the customer in Stripe. This validation step ensures that the data is in the correct format and meets any specific requirements set by Stripe.

# Processing a payment with Stripe

In our codebase, we have implemented a payment processing feature using the Stripe payment gateway. This section will explain how we integrate with Stripe to process payments.

## Wrapper module for Stripe integration

To facilitate the integration with Stripe, we have created a wrapper module that encapsulates the necessary functionality and provides a simplified interface for interacting with the Stripe API. This module can be found at `path/to/stripeWrapper.js` (see snippet).

The `stripeWrapper.js` module handles tasks such as initializing the Stripe client, creating payment intents, and handling webhook events. It abstracts away the complexity of the Stripe API and provides a more straightforward interface for our application to interact with.

Hello

## Integration flow

The integration with Stripe involves several steps to process a payment. Below, we outline the main flow of the integration and highlight any design decisions made during the process.

1.  **Initializing the Stripe client**: Before any payment processing can occur, we need to initialize the Stripe client with our API keys. This step ensures that our application is authorized to communicate with the Stripe API. The code snippet from `path/to/stripeWrapper.js` (see snippet) demonstrates how we initialize the Stripe client.

2.  **Creating a payment intent**: To initiate a payment, we create a payment intent on the server-side. This payment intent represents the payment request and holds information such as the amount, currency, and customer details. The snippet from `path/to/payment.js` (see snippet
