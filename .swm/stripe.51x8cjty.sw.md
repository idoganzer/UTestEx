# Setting up the Stripe API keys

To integrate with the Stripe API, we need to set up the necessary API keys. This section will guide you through the process of obtaining and configuring the Stripe API keys in our codebase.

## Obtaining the API keys

To obtain the Stripe API keys, follow these steps:

1.  Log in to the Stripe Dashboard.

2.  Navigate to the API section.

3.  Generate a new set of API keys for your integration.

Once you have obtained the API keys, we need to configure them in our codebase.

## Configuring the API keys

To configure the Stripe API keys in our codebase, follow these steps:

1.  Open the `config.js` file in the `src` directory.

2.  Locate the `STRIPE_API_KEY` variable.

3.  Replace the placeholder value with the actual API key obtained from the Stripe Dashboard.

```javascript
// src/config.js

const config = {
  STRIPE_API_KEY: '
```

export default config;

\` with the actual API key value.

## Verifying the API key configuration

To verify that the API key configuration is correct, you can run a test request to the Stripe API. Here's an example of how to do it:

```javascript
// src/services/stripe.js
```

# Creating a customer in Stripe

To create a customer in Stripe, we follow a specific process in our codebase. This section will outline the steps involved in creating a customer and any design decisions made during the integration process.

## Wrapper module HEllo

Before diving into the details of creating a customer in Stripe, it's important to mention that we have a wrapper module that provides a simplified interface for interacting with the Stripe API. This module abstracts away the complexities of the underlying API and provides a more streamlined integration experience.

The wrapper module can be found at `path/to/stripeWrapper.js` (see snippet).

## Integration Steps

1.  **Step 1**: To create a customer in Stripe, we first need to gather the necessary information from the user. This typically includes details such as the customer's name, email address, and payment method. The user interface for collecting this information can be found in `path/to/customerForm.js` (see snippet).

2.  **Step 2**: Once we have collected the customer information, we use the Stripe wrapper module to make a request to the Stripe API and create a new customer. The code responsible for this can be found in `path/to/createCustomer.js` (see snippet).

3.  **Step 3**: After successfully creating the customer in Stripe, we handle any additional logic or actions required in our application. This may include updating our local database, sending confirmation emails, or triggering other events. The code for handling these actions can be found
