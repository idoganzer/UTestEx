*   **ESBuild**
    
*   **What is it:** [Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)Â is a blazing fast JavaScript bundler built with Golang. Esbuild is a next-generation JavaScript bundler aimed at improving build tool performance and ease of use. And some of its main features are:
    
    *   Extreme speed without needing a cache
        
    *   ES6 and CommonJS modules
        
    *   Tree shaking of ES6 modules
        
    *   AnÂ [API](https://esbuild.github.io/api/)Â for JavaScript and Go
        
    *   [TypeScript](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#typescript)Â andÂ [JSX](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#jsx)Â syntax
        
    *   [Source maps](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#sourcemap)
        
    *   [Minification](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#minify)
        
    *   [Plugins](https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/)
        
    *   **Docs link:** [https://esbuild.github.io/](https://esbuild.github.io/) and for cloud functions: [https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/module-bundling#using\_firebase\_with\_esbuild](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/module-bundling#using_firebase_with_esbuild) .
        
    *   **Where:** In every Firebase functions codebase. For example, here is the config for the :
        

*   **Webpack**
    

*   **What is it:** Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.
    
    *   **Docs Link:** [https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) As the code bundling for the CLI is a little more tricky, We have a dedicated doc for it:
        
    *   **Where:** in our Webapp and in Our CLI. You can find the configs over here:
        
*   **NOTE:** in the near future, we might be migrating to Vite, removing Webpack from our webapp entirely. This doc should be updated when it happens.
    

# Env variables




Sometimes we are defining variables through **env** files that can later on be used by our Webapp, Cloud functions, GitHub app, the CLI, and even our tests.
