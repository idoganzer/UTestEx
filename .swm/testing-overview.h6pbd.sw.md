## Testing Frameworks

We use ghjkghjk for unit tests, and ghjkghjk for our end-to-end tests.

## Running Tests Locally

### Configure Automation User and Password

To run the tests, you first need to configure the user and password.

### Run the tests

You can then use the following commands to run tests:

`yarn test`

## Writing tests

### Assertions

{Add examples of common assertions used by tests}

### ðŸ“„ communication.js
```javascript
â¬œ 15     hjkvdflhbjsdfhlbjfdkslnbjgdfl
â¬œ 16     shyjyrwhyrwt
â¬œ 17         let now = new Date(),
ðŸŸ© 18             startString = now.getFullYear() + "-" + (now.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + (now.getDate()),
ðŸŸ© 19             end = new Date((new Date()).setDate(now.getDate() + (range || 7))),
ðŸŸ© 20             endString = end.getFullYear() + "-" + (end.getMonth() + 1) + "-" + (end.getDate());
ðŸŸ© 21         return [startString,endString]
â¬œ 22     };
â¬œ 23     
â¬œ 24     /**
```

<br/>

### Best Practices

When writing tests, we follow a few guidelines.

A group of tests is called a "suite". We now have several test suites, each one aims to test a certain set of features in the app. For example, {path for a test file} tests the {feature's name} feature.

{Add specific best practices you would like to share}

## Different Types of Tests

{Add example of types of tests: unit, integration, frontend, end-to-end, etc.}

<br/>

<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ communication.js
```javascript
â¬œ 3       * @param obj The base request string
â¬œ 4       * @param path The API path
â¬œ 5       * @return {string} A request string
ðŸŸ© 6       */
ðŸŸ© 7      const createBaseString =
ðŸŸ© 8          (obj, path) => obj.URL + path +  '?apikey=' + obj.key;
ðŸŸ© 9      
â¬œ 10     /**
â¬œ 11      * Returns two dates separated by the range indicated by the range param
â¬œ 12      * @param range
```
