## Testing Frameworks

We use IDO\_TEST for unit tests, and IDO\_TEST for our end-to-end tests.

## Running Tests Locally

### Configure Automation User and Password

To run the tests, you first need to configure the user and password.

### Run the tests

You can then use the following commands to run tests:

`yarn test`

## Writing tests

### Assertions

{Add examples of common assertions used by tests}

### Best Practices

When writing tests, we follow a few guidelines.

A group of tests is called a "suite". We now have several test suites, each one aims to test a certain set of features in the app. For example, {path for a test file} tests the feature.

{Add specific best practices you would like to share}
